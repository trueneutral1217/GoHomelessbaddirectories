# Go Homeless
I am making a game, shotgun approach, I'll figure out the details later.

added assets & code.  still working on chapter 1, code is about done for it, but I'm still working on the art and I would like to make a new song for it.
I'm using code::blocks & SDL2 for the ide & game dev libraries (respectively).  I included a snapshot of my Go Homeless folder from my hdd.
